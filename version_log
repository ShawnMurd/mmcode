mm_code_v1_0: Original code

mm_code_v1_1: Two bug fixes, one new feature
    (1) Change the way the probe ID is extracted. Use .iloc[0] instead of [0] because just using
        [0] throws an error if the first line in the mobile mesonet file triggers a QC flag (and is 
        therefore removed). Example: 14 May 2010.
    (2) Change the way t_dec is determined so that way analysis times on the next day 
        (e.g., 0100 UTC on June 6, 2009) have 24 hours added to them (just like the mobile mesonet
        decimal times). Example: 4 June 2009.
    Release Date: 18 June 2019

    New feature: Plot radar data using contourf instead of pcolormesh so plots look nicer (and to 
        please Paul)
    Date Added: 21 June 2019

mm_code_v2_0: Two bug fixes
    (1) Change the variable 'units' to 'mm_units' b/c 'units' is an alias for the units module from
        MetPy
    (2) Change line 212 in mm_code_v1_1 to read 'dataframe.iloc[i+1:, 1] += 24'
    (3) Add ability to plot mobile mesonet and radar data using Cartesian coordinates (flat-Earth
        approximation is used)
    (4) Force aspect ratio to be equal for coords == 'latlon'
    (5) Add toggle for plotting grid
    (6) Add option to change output file suffix
    (7) Remove white lines between contour areas in contourf

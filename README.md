# mmcode

This project contains a Python script to plot mobile mesonet observations from VORTEX2 on top of radar imagery (either WSR-88Ds or DOWs). The mm_plot_YYYYMMDD.py scripts are the same as plot_mobile_mesonets.py with the exception that the inputs to the script are specific to the case that occurred on YYYYMMDD. All four cases should be tested when changing plot_mobile_mesonets.py because each case contains a different nuance that might cause the program to fail.
